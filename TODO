bundle:
  * debianize sources
  * create RPM spec file

flowmon:
  * graceful quit on various signals
  * graceful quit on closing STDOUT

fmcurses.py:
  * display options: kB/s, B/s, b/s, kb/s, pkt/s, kpkt/s
  * option to execute flowmon by fmcurses.py instead of read from STDIN (and
    flowmon's options -f, -d, -i)

fmrrd.py:
  * support more than one stream
  * probably the best would be to make it a module
    * module can spawn flowmon on its own

fmcollectd.py
  * write whole thing, actually
