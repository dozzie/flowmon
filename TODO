  * add comment on what the heck is this
  * support for different window lengths for mean
  * support for 'q' key for quit
  * support for different ID, name and value attributes

fmrrd.py:
  * add comment on what the heck is this
  * support more than one stream
  * support different data record layout (now: "time","bytes","packets")
