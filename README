flowmon is a tool for displaying in real time amount of data going through
specified streams. A stream is defined as BPF filter, the same as for tcpdump.

flowmon should be handy for people working with traffic shaping, but with an
appropriate wrapper, it may be used as a source of metrics fed to monitoring
systems (collectd, Cacti, Nagios, Zenoss and so on).

flowmon comes as two tools: flowmon binary, which prints JSON records to
STDOUT and fmcurses.py, which reads JSON from STDIN and displays it on screen
(using curses).

Compilation: it should be enough to use `make'. You may need libpcapX-dev
(Debian) or libpcap-devel (Red Hat/CentOS) and GCC.

Installation: copy flowmon and fmcurses.py anywhere you feel appropriate.

How to run:

# cat savedargs
any 'tcp port 22'     'SSH'
any 'esp'             'IPsec'
any 'port 53'         'DNS'
# flowmon savedargs | fmcurses.py
# flowmon -i any -f 'tcp port 80' -d 'HTTP traffic' | fmcurses.py

In command line, if there is no description for a filter, the filter itself is
considered a description. If there is no interface name for a filter,
interface defaults to "any".
